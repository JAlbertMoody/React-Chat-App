# ReactJS Single Page Chat Application with Firebase Firestore

This is a single page chat application built using ReactJS for the framework and Firebase Firestore as the database. In order to access the platform, users are required to log in using their Google accounts via the sign-in page. Once logged in, users can proceed to the secure chat route, where they are able to contribute messages to the chat feed and peruse messages submitted by other users. The chat interface is designed with a sleek aesthetic, similar to that of Apple Chat, with user-generated messages appearing on the right side of the screen and messages from others appearing on the left side, displayed in a distinct color.
